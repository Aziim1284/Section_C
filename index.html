      <h1>Q.No.1; </h1> Write and share a small note about your choice
         of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading list of ISINs
          every 24 hours). <p>  Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? 
          If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend 
        to fix this problem at scale in production?</p>


      <p> <h1>Answer:</h1>The ISIN is a unique number assigned to a security that is universally recognizable.
        ISINs are used for numerous reasons <p>  including clearing and settlement. The numbers
         ensure a consistent format so that  </p>holdings of institutional investors can be tracked
          consistently across markets worldwide.
        <p>I would like to use because the Identifiers are the most popular form and are recognized by most global
             securities and instruments than any other identifiers.</p></p>

                <h1>Q.No.2:</h1>
                <p>Suppose you are building a financial planning tool - which requires us to fetch bank statements from the user. <p>  Now, we would like to encrypt the data - so that nobody - not even the developer can view it.</p>  What would you do to solve this problem?</p>
                <h1>Answer:</h1>
                <p>In Nodejs I will used <b>crypto </b> <em>that is Node Module</em> 
                 <p>two types of encryption method i.e; <b>Symmetric and Asymmetric method</b></p>
                 <p>We can used <b>Salt() method also for more securities</b> I will Use <b>AES-256 Algorithm</b> 
                </p>
                <p>Because this is unbrokeable by brute force  </p>
